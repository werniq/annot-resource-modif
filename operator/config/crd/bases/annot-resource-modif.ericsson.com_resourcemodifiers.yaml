                  following annotations, and a Pod resource:\n\t- removeAnyFinalizers\n
                  - sleep:50\nIt will result in removing any finalizers Pod currently
                  has, and executing a command to sleep for 50 seconds.\n\nAll examples
                  of annotations will be provided in README."
